If you use ASF in your project/company please let us know! We'd love to feature you on the site.

There has been some recent developments in this project that you might want to [read about](https://github.com/json-schema-form/angular-schema-form/wiki/Recent-developments).

Demo Time!
==========
[Try out the example page](http://schemaform.io/examples/bootstrap-example.html). Try editing the schema or form definition and see what comes out!

Hint: By pressing the 'Save to gist' button (top left), you can save your example into a shareable link.

Documentation
=============
You can find [all documentation here](docs/index.md), it covers all the different field types
and their options.

It also covers how to [extend angular schema form with your own field types](docs/extending.md).

Before filing an issue, please read our [issue support instructions](docs/support.md) or you may be ignored.

What is it?
===========

Schema Form is a set of AngularJS directives (and a couple of services). It can do two things to
make life easier:

1. Create a form directly from a JSON schema.
2. Validate form fields against that same JSON schema.

Schema Form uses convention over configuration, so it comes packaged with some sensible defaults.
But you can always customize it by changing the order and types of form fields.

#### JSON Form
Schema Form is inspired by the nice [JSON Form](https://github.com/joshfire/jsonform) library and
aims to be roughly compatible with it, especially its form definition. So what sets Schema Form
apart from JSON Form?

1. Schema Form integrates deeply with AngularJS and uses AngularJS conventions to handle forms.
2. Schema Form uses [tv4](https://github.com/geraintluff/tv4) for validation, making it compatible
   with version 4 of the JSON schema standard.
3. By default, Schema Form generates Bootstrap 3-friendly HTML.

Migration Guide
===============
If you already use the library factories in an app or an add-on or plan to upgrade versions, please read the 
[migration guide](docs/migration.md) for any items that may need consideration.

Basic Usage
-----------

First, expose your schema, form, and model to the $scope.

```javascript
angular.module('myModule', ['schemaForm'])
       .controller('FormController', function($scope) {
  $scope.schema = {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      name: { type: "string", minLength: 2, title: "Name", description: "Name or alias" },
      title: {
        type: "string",
        enum: ['dr','jr','sir','mrs','mr','NaN','dj']
      }
    }
  };

  $scope.form = [
    "*",
    {
      type: "submit",
      title: "Save"
    }
  ];

  $scope.model = {};
});
```

Then load them into Schema Form using the `sfSchema`, `sfForm`, and `sfModel` directives.

```html
<div ng-controller="FormController">
    <form sf-schema="schema" sf-form="form" sf-model="model"></form>
</div>
```

Installation
------------

### NPM

```bash
npm i angular-schema-form@latest
```
For the latest pre-release (alpha)
```bash
npm i angular-schema-form@pre-release
```

### Bower

It's simplest to install Schema Form using [Bower](http://bower.io/).
If you use the bootstrap decorator use the one from the angular-schema-form-bootstrap repo

```bash
bower install angular-schema-form angular-schema-form-bootstrap
bower install angular-schema-form angular-schema-form-bootstrap
```

This will install the latest release and basic dependencies. See
[dependencies section below](#dependencies).

You can also load the files via [cdnjs.com](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/angular-schema-form).

### Manual

You can also just download the contents of the `dist/` folder and add dependencies manually.

### Dependencies

Schema form has a lot of dependencies, most of which are optional. Schema Form depends on:

1. [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) version 1.3.x is recommended. Version 1.2.x
   has some limitation. See [known limitations](docs/knownlimitations.md).
2. [angular-sanitize](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngSanitize)
3. [tv4](https://github.com/geraintluff/tv4)
4. [bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/)

If you install via bower you get all of the above except bootstrap since we
don't want to push a certain version or flavor on you. Also make
sure you got the angular version you actually want.

#### Additional dependencies

1. If you'd like to use drag-and-drop reordering of arrays, you'll also need [ui-sortable](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-sortable) and its [jQueryUI](http://jqueryui.com/) dependencies. See the *ui-sortable* documentation for details about which parts of jQueryUI are needed. You can safely ignore these if you don't need reordering.
2. Schema Form provides tabbed arrays through the form type `tabarray`. Tab arrays default to tabs on the left side. For these to work, you'll need to include the CSS from [bootstrap-vertical-tabs](https://github.com/dbtek/bootstrap-vertical-tabs). However, you won't need Bootstrap Vertical Tabs for horizontal tabs (the `tabType: "top"` option).

The minified files include templates - no need to load additional HTML files.

### Script Loading

Schema form is split into two main files, `dist/schema-form.min.js` and
`dist/bootstrap-decorator.min.js` and they need be loaded in that order. AngularJS,
[tv4](https://github.com/geraintluff/tv4) and [objectpath](https://github.com/mike-marcacci/objectpath)
also needs to be loaded *before* Schema Form.

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="bower_components/angular/angular.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="bower_components/angular-sanitize/angular-sanitize.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="bower_components/tv4/tv4.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="bower_components/objectpath/lib/ObjectPath.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="bower_components/angular-schema-form/dist/schema-form.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="bower_components/angular-schema-form/dist/bootstrap-decorator.min.js"></script>
```

### Module loading
Don't forget to load the `schemaForm` module or nothing will happen.

```javascript
angular.module('myModule', ['schemaForm']);
```

### Webpack loading
In order to import angular-schema-form into your application you will need to
import it as follows:

`import schemaForm from 'angular-schema-form/dist/schema-form.js';`

It is important to override the `main` in the `package.json` as you will need to
utilize the `import-loader` in webpack to import angular-schema-form
dependencies like so.

```js
{
  test: require.resolve('angular-schema-form/dist/schema-form.js'),
  use: 'imports-loader?tv4,ngSanitize=angular-sanitize,objectPath=objectpath'
}
```

If you use the default minified version it will fail.

If you desire to utilize the embedded `bootstrap-decorator` in this repository
and not the update split out repository, then you will need to update your
webpack configuration as follows to resolve `schemaForm` to the proper path.

`import angularSchemaFormBootstrap from 'angular-schema-form/dist/bootstrap-decorator.js';`

```js
resolve: {
  alias:{
    schemaForm: 'angular-schema-form/dist/schema-form.js'
}

```

## Add-ons
There are several add-ons available, for a full list see the [web page](http://schemaform.io/#/third-party-addons).
Your can also [create your own add-ons!](docs/extending.md)

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Please see [Contributing.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more info.

## Building
The new Webpack compilation has made it easier to manage files and code and run build
scripts, but it is still not easy enough for users unfamiliar with it... yet.

**NOTE** in order to build simultaneously with ```json-schema-form-core``` you must have it cloned
as a sibling directory to this one **OR** npm install the version you wish to build with.

Webpack now generates a header to indicate version and date of build. **Do not create PR with the DIST folder.**

## Branch Status & New Add-On
This branch will be the **next version of Angular Schema Form**, currently please use
the **examples/example.html** file as the best example to get the framework working.

The example uses **angular-schema-form.js** and **angular-schema-form-bootstrap.js** for the
version of the code it executes, if you want your page to behave the same you
obviously need the same version!

### Add-on
To see how to make an **add-on** work I have now included the **calculate** add-on file within the **examples/add-on** directory.

## Tests
Unit tests are run with [karma](http://karma-runner.github.io) and written using
[mocha](http://mochajs.org/), [chai](http://chaijs.com/) and
[sinon](http://sinonjs.org/)

To run the tests:

1. Install all dependencies via NPM.
2. Install dev dependencies with bower.
3. Install the Karma CLI.
4. Run the tests using `npm test`.

```bash
$ npm install
$ bower install
$ npm test
```
